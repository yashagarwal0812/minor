txt = """you can smell hillary s feardaniel greenfield  a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center  is a new york writer focusing on radical islam   in the final stretch of the election  hillary rodham clinton has gone to war with the fbi   the word  unprecedented  has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired  but it s still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the fbi   but that s exactly what hillary and her people have done  coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of cnn from their hospital beds would assume that fbi director james comey is hillary s opponent in this election   the fbi is under attack by everyone from obama to cnn  hillary s people have circulated a letter attacking comey  there are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting trump  it wouldn t be too surprising if the clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the fbi   the fbi s leadership is being warned that the entire left wing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after hillary  and the fbi s credibility is being attacked by the media and the democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the clinton foundation and hillary clinton   the covert struggle between fbi agents and obama s doj people has gone explosively public   the new york times has compared comey to j  edgar hoover  its bizarre headline   james comey role recalls hoover s fbi  fairly or not  practically admits up front that it s spouting nonsense  the boston globe has published a column calling for comey s resignation  not to be outdone  time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women   james carville appeared on msnbc to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane  he accused comey of coordinating with house republicans and the kgb  and you thought the  vast right wing conspiracy  was a stretch   countless media stories charge comey with violating procedure  do you know what s a procedural violation  emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server   senator harry reid has sent comey a letter accusing him of violating the hatch act  the hatch act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of obama as the tenth amendment  but the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the wikipedia article on the hatch act under the table while accusing the fbi director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against hillary ever   if james comey is really out to hurt hillary  he picked one hell of a strange way to do it   not too long ago democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave hillary clinton a pass in a prominent public statement  if he really were out to elect trump by keeping the email scandal going  why did he trash the investigation  was he on the payroll of house republicans and the kgb back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where vladimir putin and paul ryan talked him into taking a look at anthony weiner s computer   either comey is the most cunning fbi director that ever lived or he s just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a doj leadership whose political futures are tied to hillary s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs   the only truly mysterious thing is why hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected federal agency  most americans like the fbi while hillary clinton enjoys a   unfavorable rating   and it s an interesting question   hillary s old strategy was to lie and deny that the fbi even had a criminal investigation underway  instead her associates insisted that it was a security review  the fbi corrected her and she shrugged it off  but the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the fbi   pretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy  but it was a better one that picking a fight with the fbi while lunatic clinton associates try to claim that the fbi is really the kgb   there are two possible explanations   hillary clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the fbi now that she believes that victory is near  the same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the fbi for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign   but the other explanation is that her people panicked   going to war with the fbi is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign  it s an act of desperation  when a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the fbi  that s not hubris  it s fear of what the fbi might be about to reveal about her   during the original fbi investigation  hillary clinton was confident that she could ride it out  and she had good reason for believing that  but that hillary clinton is gone  in her place is a paranoid wreck  within a short space of time the  positive  clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the fbi   there s only one reason for such bizarre behavior   the clinton campaign has decided that an fbi investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival  and so it s gone all in on fighting the fbi  it s an unprecedented step born of fear  it s hard to know whether that fear is justified  but the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot   clinton loyalists rigged the old investigation  they knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions  now suddenly they are no longer in control  and they are afraid   you can smell the fear   the fbi has wiretaps from the investigation of the clinton foundation  it s finding new emails all the time  and clintonworld panicked  the spinmeisters of clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire  all that s here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance  but this isn t how you react to smoke  it s how you respond to a fire   the misguided assault on the fbi tells us that hillary clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup  the email setup was a preemptive cover up  the clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief  right or wrong  that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed   the clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years  whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption  bribery  sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years  this is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out  and they don t want fbi investigators anywhere near it   the campaign against comey is pure intimidation  it s also a warning  any senior fbi people who value their careers are being warned to stay away  the democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the fbi  it s an ugly and unprecedented scene  it may also be their last stand   hillary clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle  but she s never shown fear or desperation before  now that has changed  whatever she is afraid of  it lies buried in her emails with huma abedin  and it can bring her down
